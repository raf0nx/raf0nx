👋 &nbsp; Hi, I’m @raf0nx

👀 &nbsp; I’m interested in software development, automotive, new technologies and strength sports.

🌱 &nbsp; I’m currently learning to write better and cleaner code, algorithms, data structures and some new javascript and node.js frameworks.

💡 &nbsp; My solutions to alogrithms on codewars: [solutions](https://www.codewars.com/users/raf0nx/completed_solutions).

💞️ &nbsp; I’m looking forward to collaborate on some interesting projects using vue.js and typescript for frontend and node.js with whatever framework on backend.
